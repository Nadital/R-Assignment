Overall, I thought the code was written well. So much detail was placed in the comments
which made it easy to follow what each step in the process was. I only had a 
few troubles with different packages conflicting (highlighted below) which were
easy to resolve. Graphs looked good, and I presume would become even better with 
a little more time. 

Some notes I thought to add:
  1.) awesome job making a reproducible example by downloading the data sets from the
      internet
  1.) adding a list of packages to load would be beneficial as some functions
      can be over-ruled if someone has two packages with functions of the same name
      ... in your code the `filter` function is used in the dplyr package as well as in the 
      stats package
